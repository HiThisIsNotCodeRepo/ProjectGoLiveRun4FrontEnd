- Work on the task search feature.
### How to make paginator work
The paginator feature is with `<mat-paginator>`tag,you can find the reference [here](https://material.angular.io/components/paginator/overview).
It has a few propertis to suit your need. Here I use `length`,`pageSize`,`pageSizeOptions`, and event `page`.
```
<mat-paginator
    #paginatorObj
    [length]="b4PaginatorFilterCourseSize"
    [pageSize]="pageSize"
    [pageSizeOptions]="pageSizeOptions"
    (page)="handlePageEvent($event)">
    >
</mat-paginator>
```
As we can see, the search page already has some input form.

That means every time when we set new value or update value the list needs to be updated. This can be achieved by RxJs operators `combineLatest`.
The paginator control needs some attention as when other inputs change the final list may change as well, to avoid any page index over the limit I have set the page number to 0 here.
```
 if (this.initComplete !== hideCompleted)
...
if (this.initCategory !== categorySlug && !flag)
...
if (this.initQuery !== query && !flag)
...

```
